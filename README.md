# 🎲 RUNE 3 – THE DICE OF DESTINY

> *“Chance favors the Builder who understands the roll.”*

Welcome, Builder!  
This is **Rune 3** from the **Dataland Builder’s Corner** —  
**The Dice of Destiny**, forged in the probability pits of *Fortuna’s Vale*.

This rune grants you the power to harness randomness, simulate events, and manipulate the forces of probability — essential tools for any data analyst, AI engineer, or curious explorer of Dataland.

## 📁 What's Inside

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dice_of_destiny.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with all examples, simulations, and visualizations |
| `random_utils.py` | Python file with utility functions for dice rolls and simulation tasks |
| `rune3.png` | Rune 3 Visual Scroll – shareable graphic |
| `README.md` | You are here 📜 |

## ⚙️ Setup

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn
````

---

## 🧪 Quick Examples

Roll 3 six-sided dice:

```python
from random_utils import roll_dice

roll_dice(n=3)
```

Simulate a coin toss with a probability of heads = 0.5 for 1000 trials:

```python
from random_utils import simulate_event

simulate_event(probability=0.5, trials=1000)
```

## ⚔️ Final Note

> 🎲 The Dice of Destiny do not lie.
> They merely uncover the patterns hidden in the chaos.
> Use them wisely, Builder.
